Minetest mod "Creatures"
=======================
by BlockMen (c) 2014

Version: 1.0.1 Beta

About
~~~~~
This mod add (currently only) hostile mobs to Minetest, so far Zombies and Ghosts.

Zombies can spawn to every day-time in the world as long there is not to much light.
So you will find some in caves, dark forests and ofc a lot at night. If they notice you they will attack.
Zombies have 20 HP (like players) and drop rotten flesh randomly.

Ghosts only spawn at night-time. Also they don't spawn underground and are a bit more rare than zombies.
They are flying in the world and attack you aswell if they notice you.
Ghosts have 15 HP and don't drop any items atm (might be changed if i have an idea what they could drop).

They can't harm you in your house (in case there is no door open). If it becomes day both mobs will take damage
by the sunlight, so they will die after a while.


Notice: You weapons get damage when hitting a zombie or ghost.
